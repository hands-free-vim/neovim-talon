        This requires some special casing because of support for direct key
        input. This means that certain commands will come in a newline
        character if the command is meant to be executed immediately, otherwise
        the intention is actually to let the user continue to interact after
        the input goes in, in which case we actually redirect back to the
        direct input from here.

        NOTE: This has some pretty significant quirks compared to is running
        commands with direct input. For instance if you have a command declared
        that maps to a function, like "command! :Files fzf#blah" you need a
        very specific invocation for this to work, which is `:exe ":Files"\n` .
        Since we want these comments to work generically across systems that
        have both RPC and not, unfortunately it means we need to rely on the
        more complicated invocation even for when were not using RPC, to avoid
        the duplication... there might be some better way to do this but I
        haven't figured it out yet.
